Casio CA-53W - The Retro Calculator Watch for the Pebble
========================================================
Step back into 80's and 90's pop culture with the [Casio CA-53W][1], the retro calculator watch worn by Walter White from "Breaking Bad" and Marty McFly from "Back to the Future". Hand pixelated by myself, this [Pebble][2] watchface stays true to the [original][3] with every minute detail. From the location of each part of the time and date display to the text decorated around the watchface, I hope that you enjoy wearing this on your wrist, and possibly feel a little sense of nostalgia.

If you found an issue, please report it here.

Features
--------
 - Original retro display that includes day, hour, minute, second, and period
 - Date display mode from the original watch that shows by a quick shake, lasting three seconds
 - Bluetooth connectivity notification in place of the time signal notification of the original
 - Battery notification in place of the alarm notification of the original

To-Do
-----
Nothing so far. Suggestions are appreciated!
